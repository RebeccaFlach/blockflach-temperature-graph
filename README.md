# blockflach-temperature-graph
A graph of a bunch of temperatures recorded in and around our house, as a project to learn d3.js

There are two parts. The first is the graph (the file is index.md, because the graph is a github page). The second is a website, that displays live temperatures. This has been pretty useful for quickly checking the temperatures, especially because weather apps in our area can be often inaccurate. Because everything is locally hosted, demonstrating this would not work because it could not get the temperatures. However, you can see the code, in the file named temperature_project.html
